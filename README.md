# My_Calculator
Project Description: Python Calculator
he Python Calculator project is a simple yet functional application built using Python and the Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI) development. This project serves as a practical implementation of core programming concepts learned during my coding journey, particularly during the first 35 days of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, providing a user-friendly experience.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface:

The calculator has a clean and intuitive GUI that allows users to interact with it effortlessly. Buttons are clearly labeled, making it easy for users to perform calculations without confusion.
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Supports four primary operations:
Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication (x): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.
Real-Time Display:

The current input and result are displayed in real time, allowing users to see their calculations as they input numbers and select operations. This feature enhances user engagement and ensures transparency in calculations.
Modular Code Structure:

The project follows a modular approach, separating the calculator logic (backend) from the graphical interface (frontend). This structure makes the code more organized, easier to read, and maintainable.
The calculator's logic is encapsulated in the CalBack class, which handles arithmetic operations and stores the current state.

Clear Functionality:

A clear button resets the calculator, allowing users to start fresh with a single click. This feature enhances usability, especially during multiple calculations.
Interactive Buttons:

Each number and operation has its own button, making it easy to input data quickly. The buttons are designed to be responsive and visually appealing.
Visual Design:

The calculator features a modern and visually appealing design with a consistent color scheme and font. The choice of colors and fonts contributes to an aesthetically pleasing user experience.
Technical Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Library: Tkinter (for GUI development)
Structure: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
